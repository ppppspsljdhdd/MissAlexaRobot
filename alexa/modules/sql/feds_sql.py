#                         GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
#                            Version 3, 19 November 2007
#
#      Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
#      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
#      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
#
#                                 Preamble
#
#       The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
#     software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
#     cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
#
#       The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
#     to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
#     our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
#     share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
#     software for all its users.
#
#       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
#     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
#     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
#     them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
#     want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
#     free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
#
#       Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
#     with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
#     you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
#     and/or modify the software.
#
#       A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
#     improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
#     receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
#     incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
#     encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
#     software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
#     The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
#     letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
#     source code to the public.
#
#       The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
#     ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
#     to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
#     provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
#     users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
#     a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
#     code of the modified version.
#
#       An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
#     published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
#     a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
#     released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
#     this license.
#
#       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
#     modification follow.
#
#                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS
#
#       0. Definitions.
#
#       "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
#
#       "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
#     works, such as semiconductor masks.
#
#       "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
#     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
#     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
#
#       To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
#     in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
#     exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
#     earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
#
#       A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
#     on the Program.
#
#       To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
#     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
#     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
#     computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
#     distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
#     public, and in some countries other activities as well.
#
#       To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
#     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
#     a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
#
#       An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
#     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
#     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
#     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
#     extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
#     work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
#     the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
#     menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
#
#       1. Source Code.
#
#       The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
#     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
#     form of a work.
#
#       A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
#     standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
#     interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
#     is widely used among developers working in that language.
#
#       The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
#     than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
#     packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
#     Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
#     Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
#     implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
#     "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
#     (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
#     (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
#     produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
#
#       The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
#     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
#     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
#     control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
#     System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
#     programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
#     which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
#     includes interface definition files associated with source files for
#     the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
#     linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
#     such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
#     subprograms and other parts of the work.
#
#       The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
#     can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
#     Source.
#
#       The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
#     same work.
#
#       2. Basic Permissions.
#
#       All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
#     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
#     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
#     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
#     covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
#     content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
#     rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
#
#       You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
#     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
#     in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
#     of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
#     with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
#     the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
#     not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
#     for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
#     and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
#     your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
#
#       Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
#     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
#     makes it unnecessary.
#
#       3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
#
#       No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
#     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
#     11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
#     similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
#     measures.
#
#       When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
#     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
#     is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
#     the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
#     modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
#     users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
#     technological measures.
#
#       4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
#
#       You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
#     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
#     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
#     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
#     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
#     keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
#     recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
#
#       You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
#     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
#
#       5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
#
#       You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
#     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
#     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
#
#         a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
#         it, and giving a relevant date.
#
#         b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
#         released under this License and any conditions added under section
#         7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
#         "keep intact all notices".
#
#         c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
#         License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
#         License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
#         additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
#         regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
#         permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
#         invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
#
#         d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
#         Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
#         interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
#         work need not make them do so.
#
#       A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
#     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
#     and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
#     in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
#     "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
#     used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
#     beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
#     in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
#     parts of the aggregate.
#
#       6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
#
#       You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
#     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
#     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
#     in one of these ways:
#
#         a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
#         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
#         Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
#         customarily used for software interchange.
#
#         b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
#         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
#         written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
#         long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
#         model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
#         copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
#         product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
#         medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
#         more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
#         conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
#         Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
#
#         c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
#         written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
#         alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
#         only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
#         with subsection 6b.
#
#         d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
#         place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
#         Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
#         further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
#         Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
#         copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
#         may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
#         that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
#         clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
#         Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
#         Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
#         available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
#
#         e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
#         you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
#         Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
#         charge under subsection 6d.
#
#       A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
#     from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
#     included in conveying the object code work.
#
#       A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
#     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
#     or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
#     into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
#     doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
#     product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
#     typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
#     of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
#     actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
#     is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
#     commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
#     the only significant mode of use of the product.
#
#       "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
#     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
#     and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
#     a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
#     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
#     code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
#     modification has been made.
#
#       If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
#     specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
#     part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
#     User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
#     fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
#     Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
#     by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
#     if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
#     modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
#     been installed in ROM).
#
#       The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
#     requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
#     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
#     the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
#     network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
#     adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
#     protocols for communication across the network.
#
#       Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
#     in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
#     documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
#     source code form), and must require no special password or key for
#     unpacking, reading or copying.
#
#       7. Additional Terms.
#
#       "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
#     License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
#     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
#     be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
#     that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
#     apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
#     under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
#     this License without regard to the additional permissions.
#
#       When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
#     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
#     it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
#     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
#     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
#     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
#
#       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
#     add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
#     that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
#
#         a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
#         terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
#
#         b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
#         author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
#         Notices displayed by works containing it; or
#
#         c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
#         requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
#         reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
#
#         d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
#         authors of the material; or
#
#         e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
#         trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
#
#         f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
#         material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
#         it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
#         any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
#         those licensors and authors.
#
#       All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
#     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
#     received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
#     governed by this License along with a term that is a further
#     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
#     a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
#     License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
#     of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
#     not survive such relicensing or conveying.
#
#       If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
#     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
#     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
#     where to find the applicable terms.
#
#       Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
#     form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
#     the above requirements apply either way.
#
#       8. Termination.
#
#       You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
#     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
#     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
#     this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
#     paragraph of section 11).
#
#       However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
#     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
#     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
#     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
#     holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
#     prior to 60 days after the cessation.
#
#       Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
#     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
#     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
#     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
#     copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
#     your receipt of the notice.
#
#       Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
#     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
#     this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
#     reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
#     material under section 10.
#
#       9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
#
#       You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
#     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
#     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
#     to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
#     nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
#     modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
#     not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
#     covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
#
#       10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
#
#       Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
#     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
#     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
#     for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
#
#       An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
#     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
#     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
#     work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
#     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
#     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
#     give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
#     Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
#     the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
#
#       You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
#     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
#     not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
#     rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
#     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
#     any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
#     sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
#
#       11. Patents.
#
#       A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
#     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
#     work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
#
#       A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
#     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
#     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
#     by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
#     but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
#     consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
#     purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
#     patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
#     this License.
#
#       Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
#     patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
#     make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
#     propagate the contents of its contributor version.
#
#       In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
#     agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
#     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
#     sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
#     party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
#     patent against the party.
#
#       If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
#     and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
#     to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
#     publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
#     then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
#     available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
#     patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
#     consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
#     license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
#     actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
#     covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
#     in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
#     country that you have reason to believe are valid.
#
#       If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
#     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
#     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
#     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
#     or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
#     you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
#     work and works based on it.
#
#       A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
#     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
#     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
#     specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
#     work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
#     in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
#     to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
#     the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
#     parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
#     patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
#     conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
#     for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
#     contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
#     or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
#
#       Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
#     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
#     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
#
#       12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
#
#       If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
#     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
#     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
#     covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
#     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
#     not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
#     to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
#     the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
#     License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
#
#       13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
#
#       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
#     Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
#     interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
#     supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
#     Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
#     from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
#     means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
#     shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
#     of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
#     following paragraph.
#
#       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
#     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
#     under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
#     combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
#     License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
#     but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
#     3 of the GNU General Public License.
#
#       14. Revised Versions of this License.
#
#       The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
#     the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
#     will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
#     address new problems or concerns.
#
#       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
#     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
#     Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
#     option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
#     version or of any later version published by the Free Software
#     Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
#     GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
#     by the Free Software Foundation.
#
#       If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
#     versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
#     public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
#     to choose that version for the Program.
#
#       Later license versions may give you additional or different
#     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
#     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
#     later version.
#
#       15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
#
#       THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
#     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
#     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
#     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
#     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
#     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
#     IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
#     ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
#
#       16. Limitation of Liability.
#
#       IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
#     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
#     THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
#     GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
#     USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
#     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
#     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
#     EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
#     SUCH DAMAGES.
#
#       17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
#
#       If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
#     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
#     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
#     an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
#     Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
#     copy of the Program in return for a fee.
#
#                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
#
#                 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
#
#       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
#     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
#     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
#
#       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
#     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
#     state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
#     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
#
#         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
#         Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
#
#         This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
#         it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
#         by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
#         (at your option) any later version.
#
#         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
#         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
#         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
#         GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
#
#         You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
#         along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
#
#     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
#
#       If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
#     network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
#     get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
#     interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
#     of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
#     solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
#     specific requirements.
#
#       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
#     if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
#     For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
#     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
